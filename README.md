# Reviewi

Reviewi.me is currently offline.

Reviewi as a project created, for fun, to automate the process of retrieval of product review from different Amazon website.

After creting for myself I decided to provide it as a service to others which might have that need.

Based on a ASIN code, Reviewi could retrive the reviews from all the specified regional Amazon sites and send the list via email.

The application was based on a web UI based on HTML,CSS,Javascript and PHP and a Python backend.
The infrastructure was hosted in AWS, and made of a S3, Postgres DB, a webserver and Route 53.

The project was live till 2019 and it had around 50 users using it regurarly. 
The work to restructure the backend and add an integration layer leveragin few APIswas started but never concluded.
Reviewi.me was shut down since it was hard to keep up with the improvement made on Amazons site to prevent webscraping.
